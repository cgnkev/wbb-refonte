Built by the DDR as a symbol of the east, a beacon of progress, it remains one of the most distinctive buildings in the city, an enormous silver ball perched atop a silver spike and capped with a red and white striped needle reminiscent of the rocket in Tintin: Destination Moon, a mid-twentieth century view of the future.  Speaking of views, the building also houses a restaurant and a fully stocked bar that offers – at 203 metres above Berlin - one of the highest and best panoramas of the city. This is the place to head to take in a classic cocktail while looking out on the bustle of Berlin below and musing on the complex changes that century has wrought on the place. You’ll be aided in your contemplation by the revolving of the restaurant as it makes a full 360-degree rotation every 30 minutes. It’s a white, light space, the view the main focus of the room, the Reichstag and the Tiergarten dotted below. Grab a glass of wine or a G&T and play spot the landmark. On a clear day you can see for well over twenty miles around.Bar Interior Photographer: Katrin Bernsteiner;52.52200323063235,13.410165544379947;http://www.tv-turm.de/de/bar.php;;;;;;;;;;Bar,Lounge;;true;;;$$$;cash,creditcards;;;;;;;;;;177527496;http://instagram.com/Bar+203;;524c7f9711d259b1d4cd219a;https://foursquare.com/v/bar-203/524c7f9711d259b1d4cd219a;;;2;24;1;;true;[County, Street2, Website, Category, OutdoorSeating, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Country, Street1, GeocoordinateString]

The interior is done in plush, modern white tones which effectively accentuates the coffee-brown skin of the designer-clad girls from Ipanema who come walking by. As if they needed the help! In the upstairs lounge and restaurant you can grab bites of succulent sushi and fine cocktails, while the club is in a larger downstairs space, with home-grown DJs specialising in American house that is perfect for dancing. There are dozens of nearby spots to visit should the sight of shapely model types bore you.  ;-22.983176031082,-43.205494634529;http://www.baronneti.com.br;;5,52E+11;;;;;;;;Nightlife,Nightclub,House;;;;;;;;;;;;1,44E+14;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Baronetti/143547512383532;;;308678041;http://instagram.com/Baronetti;;;;628;4448;;;;;true;[PostalCode, Website, Category, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins];[Street1, GeocoordinateString, Phone]

The two balconies, on both sides of the street, are popular spots to both see and be seen, and as this lively nightlife area is usually heaving with revellers there’s plenty to look at. However, the inside lounge is possibly even better than the terraces, with a long circular bar that is a throwback to Fifties Hollywood. We grant you the soft sofas are more 'Friends' than 'Frank' but it shouldn't stop you lighting up a cigar and sipping on a whiskey. Pull up a bar stool or grab a seat at one of the tables. Upstairs, another bar offers a fine aerial view of the soi, plus games machines and a karaoke lounge for potential revelry. The cabaret nights here are hotly anticipated and the bar also hosts a range of special events during festive periods. Open from 5:30pm till late, the bar offers a range of Thai dishes and international fast food, so you can settle in for a night of eating and drinking. Happy hour runs from 5:30 – 8pm, with deals on house drinks, jugs of cocktails and beer pitchers, but the crowds really start piling in around 9:30pm.Silom Soi 4 is well known for its gay nightlife and The Balcony is a gay bar, but straight – and curious -clients are warmly welcomed too. The resulting crowd is made up of a heady mix of trendsetters and adventurous tourists – the perfect recipe for a fun night out.;13.728538865417331,100.5328332902989;http://www.balconypub.com;info@balconypub.com;6622355891;;;;;;;;Bar,Gay,Nightlife,Nightclub;;true;true;true;;cash,creditcards;;;;;;;;;;1451081;http://instagram.com/The+Balcony;;4b0587f7f964a5206aa922e3;https://foursquare.com/v/the-balcony/4b0587f7f964a5206aa922e3;;;19;1781;16;;true;[County, Category, OutdoorSeating, HappyHour, Wifi, PaymentAccepted, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Street1, GeocoordinateString, Phone]

Sandia Chang and James Knappett's hotly anticipated Charlotte Street joint serves ten kinds of dog in a handsome space featuring exposed brickwork, wood panelling and stylish mirrors. The K-Dog, topped with spicy kimchee, and the guacamole-laden José are the top dogs, but there’s fun to be had working your way through the whole menu.

Located in Piazza Mattei, it's a grand interior, with ornate ceilings and furniture, complimented by a pricey yet creative drinks list. Music runs from soul and funk to house and techno and gets louder as the night goes on, when those dusky Roman beauties in Versace hit the dance floor. It's open late but we say get there early to book your place at the bar. And keep your eyes on those beauties.;41.8937,12.4775;http://www.bartaruga.com/;;00 39 6689 2299;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;false;[];[]

In Dante's Inferno, the lustful are buffeted  by winds symbolising  their passions. And so to Cafe Lust, which takes the set up of a traditional Dutch brown cafe and gives it a modern spin. It fervidly popular with locals and foreigners alike. Alongside beer, this small, welcoming bar serves a mean cocktail and on weekends the house DJs play a funky selection of tunes with a decidedly Latin edge well into the night.  Top tipples include Strawberry Collins, Frozen Daiquiri and the intriguingly named Out of Africa ( Gin, Safari, jus d'orange, lime, lemon juice and a splash of grenadine for good measure. The wine list or ""winkaart"" is far better than one might imagine. On it, find such heavyweights as the uber-crisp Tenuta Olim Bauda, Piemonte Chardoand the mighty Accordini, Amarone della Valpolicella Classico Acinatico 2007, an ideal and highly agreeable companion to a spot of supper. And on the subject of nosh, the food here is well worth your time.  It comes for the most part in the form of tasty small plates which nod to the Mediterranean and to the Far East. The result is less a culinary Babel of tongues and more a harmonious synthesis of opposites. In addition to such fripperies as Charcuterie platters, salads and the like, there are more substantial offerings to be had. Cheif among them is the Beef Sashimi, Black Angus Steak and a hefty essay in Surf and Turf. The terrace may make it particularly popular in summer but make no mistake, this is a hot spot all year round.";52.093122,5.124986;http://cafelust.nl;;31302382421;closed;closed;closed;closed;closed;closed;closed;Bar,Pub;;false;;;$;;dinner;;;;;1,94E+14;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Caf%C3%A9-Lust/194162850624008;;;2198115;http://instagram.com/Caf%C3%A9+Lust;;4afde594f964a520de2b22e3;https://foursquare.com/v/caf%C3%A9-lust/4afde594f964a520de2b22e3;111;3704;5;677;5;;true;[County, PostalCode, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, OutdoorSeating, PriceRange, RestaurantServices, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[GeocoordinateString, Website, Phone]

The original Sam’s was the precursor to Red Robin and the owner of this new venture is part of the family who launched the famous burger chain. The 21st century Sam’s is a classic American tavern with a rugged roadhouse vibe. Occupying the former home of Chino’s on Capitol Hill, the space has been refitted with reclaimed wood tables, a bar inset with an array of shiny copper pennies and a dramatic antler chandelier. This is not a place that cares over-much for trends and fashions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
