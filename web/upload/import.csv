Built by the DDR as a symbol of the east, a beacon of progress, it remains one of the most distinctive buildings in the city, an enormous silver ball perched atop a silver spike and capped with a red and white striped needle reminiscent of the rocket in Tintin: Destination Moon, a mid-twentieth century view of the future. Speaking of views, the building also houses a restaurant and a fully stocked bar that offers – at 203 metres above Berlin - one of the highest and best panoramas of the city. This is the place to head to take in a classic cocktail while looking out on the bustle of Berlin below and musing on the complex changes that century has wrought on the place. You’ll be aided in your contemplation by the revolving of the restaurant as it makes a full 360-degree rotation every 30 minutes. It’s a white, light space, the view the main focus of the room, the Reichstag and the Tiergarten dotted below. Grab a glass of wine or a G&T and play spot the landmark. On a clear day you can see for well over twenty miles around.Bar Interior Photographer: Katrin Bernsteiner;52.52200323063235,13.410165544379947;http://www.tv-turm.de/de/bar.php;;;;;;;;;;Bar,Lounge;;true;;;$$$;cash,creditcards;;;;;;;;;;177527496;http://instagram.com/Bar+203;;524c7f9711d259b1d4cd219a;https://foursquare.com/v/bar-203/524c7f9711d259b1d4cd219a;;;2;24;1;;true;[County, Street2, Website, Category, OutdoorSeating, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Country, Street1, GeocoordinateString]

The two balconies, on both sides of the street, are popular spots to both see and be seen, and as this lively nightlife area is usually heaving with revellers there’s plenty to look at. However, the inside lounge is possibly even better than the terraces, with a long circular bar that is a throwback to Fifties Hollywood. We grant you the soft sofas are more 'Friends' than 'Frank' but it shouldn't stop you lighting up a cigar and sipping on a whiskey. Pull up a bar stool or grab a seat at one of the tables. Upstairs, another bar offers a fine aerial view of the soi, plus games machines and a karaoke lounge for potential revelry. The cabaret nights here are hotly anticipated and the bar also hosts a range of special events during festive periods. Open from 5:30pm till late, the bar offers a range of Thai dishes and international fast food, so you can settle in for a night of eating and drinking. Happy hour runs from 5:30 – 8pm, with deals on house drinks, jugs of cocktails and beer pitchers, but the crowds really start piling in around 9:30pm.Silom Soi 4 is well known for its gay nightlife and The Balcony is a gay bar, but straight – and curious -clients are warmly welcomed too.

Having started out manning a south London burger wagon, serving what many regarded as the best, most deliciously filthy burgers in the city, now encompasses three permanent venues. The faintly illicit MeatLiquor (just off Oxford Street, hidden behind a branch of Debenhams), Covent Garden’s MeatMarket and now east London’s MEATMission, a burger temple in a former mission hall with a striking Gilbert and George-esque stained glass ceiling. This new outpost offers goodies not available at previous incarnations – including the ridiculously addictive Monkey Fingers – as well as all the staples, including their famous bingo wings and those perfect American-style burgers – the Dead Hippie is a favourite with the blogosphere – plus a few artery-hardening glories like their ‘chilli garbage plate.’Cocktails are potent and just as wicked as the food on offer. The Pinot Grinchio packs a considerable kick for a drink that mixes white wine and apple juice and the Peckham Negroni is also a joy. They’ve got an impressive range of beers on tap too and this venue doesn’t seem to get quite as rammed as the Welbeck Street original, so there are less insane queues (though that may well change) and it feels like a place you might linger in for longer, rather than simply eating and running.

;6vorne;DE;Berlin;Berlin;10711;;Hektorstrasse 11;;'6vorne' is all about numbers. Its cryptic name translates as 'six forward' which, contrary to some suggestions, is not a reference to the contorted pleasures of Twister.;'6vorne' is all about numbers. Its cryptic name translates as 'six forward' which, contrary to some suggestions, is not a reference to the contorted pleasures of Twister. Its other numerical boast is that it stocks 100 different vodkas, enough to sate the palette of the most discerning vodka connoisseur. There’s an imaginative and interesting list of cocktails on offer (and don’t worry, they don’t all have vodka in them) and they’re reasonably priced and competently made. On the aesthetic front, think clean lines, dark walnut features, lashings of Germanic minimalism (if that's not a contradiction in terms) all bathed in the most wonderful of orange and green lights. Sloping white seats and futuristic wall spaces give it a slightly Kubrickian air, that sense of retro meets futurism (think 2001: A Space Odyssey meets the Clockwork Orange Milk Bar). In fact, you may find yourself slightly mesmerised by the backlit bottle shelves that line some of the walls.  (The interior is courtesy of local designers Murat Top and Alen Aronov).  It’s little surprise then that the place has become a hit with the young Berlin creative and fashion types, who throng here to enjoy classy cocktails in chic surroundings to a soundtrack of subdued electronica and house, though it also does show sporting events sometimes so do check your calendar. It also isn’t an enormous space so can get very busy at peak times and at weekends.  But in a city that’s famous for its cocktail scene, 6vorne still manages to stand out, so it’s well worth a visit.;52.5010111,13.2979551;;alen@6vorne.de;491 636 061 666;;;;;;;;Bar;;true;;;$$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;4adcda79f964a520ba4621e3;https://foursquare.com/v/6vorne/4adcda79f964a520ba4621e3;;;0;24;0;;true;[County, Category, OutdoorSeating, PriceRange, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Street1, GeocoordinateString]

This bar boasts both an underground location and an appropriately underground atmosphere.  Inside, low lighting and lots of red add up to warm glow that sets the mood – there are lots of comfortable couches to recline on should you be in a reclining mood, though the entertainment might keep you upright. Because music is a very big deal here and they often have live music from local bands plus the cream of Queenstown's DJ talent – the sound system is the best in town. The music changes from night to night, but hip-hop, dancehall, funk and r’n’b feature prominently, so there’s always something decent on offer, and the venue also has a good track record in attracting international talent. The atmosphere is lively and colourful, and the place hums with people having a good time and eager to party. They also hold regular art exhibitions for the culturally inclined. The bar offers a range of fruity, well-made cocktails and a decent wine list – it’s that rare venue that prides itself on its drinks as much as the entertainment (alas the two often don’t go hand in hand), styling itself solidly as a cocktail bar as well as a nightclub, so you can order in confidence that the staff tend to know what they’re doing! There are also drinks offers most nights from 9pm should you be partying on a budget (the place is open 4 nights a week).

( Protractors may not be used) Few would take issue with the thesis that it’s one of its best designed spaces: its dazzlingly bright, white bar has a long counter on one side of the room above which runs a floral frieze providing artful splashes of colour. A more formal dining-room boasts is hung with striking paintings and features an arresting sculpture of silver coral, all of which is bathed in suitably romantic light.  The powers that be of Papaya say of it : ""If we go down the stairs we will reach the second room, whose interiors give the impression of a daydream on the bottom of the sea."" Mere fluff? Not a bit of it. An open kitchen ( a not unwelcome addition to the terminally suspicious) allows one to see  the chefs at work, a spectacle that at times borders on theatre, particularly when they’re unleashed on the modish teppanyaki grill. As for the bill of fare, it, too, has its moments of theatre.  Leading the charge are classic dishes from the Far East. Examples include the utterly scrumptious banana leaf and class pad Thai, traditional papaya salad and that perennial favourite, green curry. What these chaps can't do with that quartet of Thai ingredients ( lemongrass, chillis, ginger, galangal,) frankly isn't worth knowing.  The seafood is as fresh as it comes, too ( why, the oysters and lobsters are plucked from the aquarium) and they have a hefty wine list too. All of which, alas, comes with an equally hefty price tag.

Over at Honey – or, to give the place its full name, The Honey Champagne Cocktail Bar, they have 30 types of champagne including all your favourites, as well as a delectable champagne cocktail with crushed mint that will have you begging for more. Housed in the old headquarters of an insurance company, the venue has been sympathetically done out, combining classical charm with modern drinking den.  The stylish setting boasting marble and oak bars, plenty of comfortable couches to recline on, a real fire for when the nights get cold and lots of old fashioned lamps casting a flattering lighting over the patrons, making it a good spot for a romantic evening. The heritage ceilings and vintage posters speak of the building’s original purpose, but now it’s a temple to the choicest champagne and the well-made cocktail, with over 60 varieties on offer, as well as a very good selection of beers and a seriously tempting range of New Zealand wines. (If you have a sweet tooth, we’d recommend the vodka-based Apple Crumble cocktail – it’s dessert in a glass!) There's a roof deck to chill out on when the weather gets warmer, so relax and check out the hipsters who've made this place their home from home.

This casual neighbourhood drinking and dining spot offers a list of creative drinks which are all designed to pair with dishes from their small plate menu. So the 9-5, an aromatic blend of gin, Combier  FDR, Spiced Perique, and Apricot Bitters goes well with olives and almonds, while their decadent Maine lobster BLT has been paired with a Modern Man’s Manhattan, a drink which mixes rye, vermouth and aromatic bitters. The lobster mac ‘n’ cheese, meanwhile, has been paired with an Old Fashioned made with brown butter-infused bourbon, a stiff drink designed to cut throw the richness, while the Apple Orchard, a blend of Apple Brandy, Orgeat, and Black Walnut Bitters works well with their cheese plate. A similar approach has been taken with their beer menu, the various ales and lagers chosen to go well with the food menu, ditto the wine list. It’s all too easy to opt for a bottle of a familiar white, but here the whole menu is set up to allow you to explore flavour pairings, while trying new wines, many of which are available by the glass. It’s a cool concept, well executed, and we applaud them for it.Photography by - Anthony Tahlier;41.91781226954795,-87.64851000425841;http://coppervinechicago.com;;17739351000;closed;17:00-22:00;17:00-22:00;17:00-22:00;17:00-23:00;17:00-23:00;17:00-21:00;Restaurant;Casual;false;;;$$;cash,amex,mastercard,visa,discover;dinner;foursquare.com/v/coppervine/529e820a11d2a50bde5c3f87/menu;http://www.opentable.com/single.aspx?rid=116545&ref=9601;street,valet;;5,27013E+14;https://www.facebook.com/coppervinechicago;;;174615071;http://instagram.com/Coppervine;;529e820a11d2a50bde5c3f87;https://foursquare.com/v/coppervine/529e820a11d2a50bde5c3f87;428;914;8;237;7;;true;[County, PostalCode, Website, Phone, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, Mood, OutdoorSeating, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, MenuUrl, Booking, ParkingType, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Country, GeocoordinateString]

The room itself is a bit poky, but some smart use of wood panelling and red velvet makes gives the space a kind of clubby charm. The walls are lined with cabinets housing an array of vintage cocktail related paraphernalia - but all of this is mere backdrop for the main event, the drinks themselves. The list is exciting and varied, with drinks dating back to the birth of the cocktail. They use premium ingredients and have an inventive list of contemporary cocktails, which are delivered with equal care and attention to detail. They serve other drinks and have a decent wine list, but to be honest, you’d be remiss not to at least sample one of their cocktails when they’re as good as this.;-37.81165850192967,144.97027502740272;http://1806.com.au;;61396637722;17:00-02:00;17:00-02:00;17:00-02:00;17:00-02:00;17:00-04:00;17:00-04:00;19:00-02:00;Bar,Cocktail,Wine,Lounge;Casual;false;;false;$$;cash,amex,mastercard,visa;groups,reserve;foursquare.com/v/1806/4b0681dff964a5207dec22e3/menu;;street,lot;;1,9742E+14;https://www.facebook.com/eighteenOsix;drinks1806;https://www.twitter.com/drinks1806;275572;http://instagram.com/1806;;4b0681dff964a5207dec22e3;https://foursquare.com/v/1806/4b0681dff964a5207dec22e3;3607;21978;46;2362;55;;true;[County, PostalCode, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, Mood, OutdoorSeating, Wifi, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, MenuUrl, ParkingType, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, TwitterName, TwitterUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Street1, GeocoordinateString, Website, Phone]

The main lure though is the four American-style, yellow-topped pool tables, which are usually surrounded by lively groups of people toting pool cues and bottles of beer. The Clerkenwell bar serves up top notch cocktails (we really like the sound of their Peppered Passion, a concoction of rum, passion fruit puree, lime and black pepper) and superior snacks – their burgers have a particularly good rep.

Housed in the former home of Barcelona’s newspaper, El Noticiero Universal,  (so one assumes that’s where they got the name) the space has been inventively rejigged by designer Francesc Pons to make for a pleasant, quality drinking experience. Walking in, you’re faced with a stylish bar area where you can idle over the cocktail of the day or explore the substantial Spanish wine list. Then, in the glamorous dining room - all red and black with lots of mirrors - you can sample an array of tasty modern dishes from a menu courtesy of Christian Crespin and Elena Barta. The fish is market fresh so worth trying, or plump for one of the quality meat dishes (for the discerning carnivore, steak tartare comes recommended). They do a lunch offer, too, if you’re on a budget but still want to sample the superior cuisine. The cocktails are well made by bar tenders who know their trade and care about their offering, so you’re guaranteed a decent drink. Should you want to enjoy your meal or drinks away from peering eyes, you can reserve a private space for your party. Smooth jazz filters through the air and there are occasional live DJ sessions to pep things up. The atmosphere is infectious, with the place attracting a sophisticated, urban crowd rather than simply a lot of tourist gawkers, drawn by the laid back, cool atmosphere and super-chic setting. Handily located to explore the rest of the city, Noti is one of Barcelona’s gems.;41.392285129816,2.169878995562;http://noti-universal.com/;;34933426673;;;;;;;;Bar,Cafe,Restaurant;;;;;;;;;;;;2,01238E+14;https://www.facebook.com/pages/NOTI/201237599915519;;;;;;;;18;0;;;;;true;[Category, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins];[PostalCode, Street1, GeocoordinateString]

They have a frequently rotating cocktail list and the opening hours make it the perfect stop off for a late night tipple. They also serve an array of lovely things on which to nibble, with both their starters and desserts served in miniature portions, which is great if you’re indecisive or if you only want a tiny bite, though ‘normal’ sized meals are available too. Mains (or in this case, ‘middles’) are modern European in influence, pan roast pork fillet, butter-poached brill and the like. Desserts are worth saving room for, particularly the praline chocolate tart.  The prices are reasonable and the place is simply but attractively, decorated, slightly pub-like in atmosphere, busy and buzzy, with candles on the table-tops and warm, dark walls.

Mirrors line the walls and there's a large bar area where one can partake of a pre-dinner drink, a Kir Royal perhaps or a signature Belle Epoque cocktail of calavados, fresh mint, apple juice and champagne. There's a large selection of aperitifs and a wine list that features a decent selection of wines by the glass as well as an impressive array of champagnes. The next door patisserie is a great place to pick up a baguette, a pastry or a coffee served in the flat-white style.;-27.4527708888,153.03922988409;http://www.belleepoque.com.au;;61738521500;07:00-10:30,12:00-23:00;07:00-10:30,12:00-23:00;07:00-10:30,12:00-23:00;07:00-10:30,12:00-23:00;07:00-10:30,12:00-23:00;07:00-12:00,12:30-22:30;07:00-12:00,12:30-22:30;Bar,Cafe,Restaurant;;true;;;;cash,amex,mastercard,visa;groups,reserve,dinner,lunch;;;street,lot,valet;Bus routes - 360, 361, 364Train stations - Fortitude Valley & Bowen Hills;1,75241E+11;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Belle-%C3%89poque-Bistro-Brisbane/175241171374;738521500;https://www.twitter.com/0738521500;2079509;http://instagram.com/Belle+%C3%89poque+Bistro+-+Brisbane;;4cb5429cf6616dcbc986d608;https://foursquare.com/v/belle-epoque-patisserie/4cb5429cf6616dcbc986d608;175;1917;4;443;6;;true;[County, PostalCode, Phone, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, OutdoorSeating, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, ParkingType, PublicTransport, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, TwitterName, TwitterUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Street1, GeocoordinateString, Website]

Our stylish French friends have refurbished the oldest pub in Paris, giving it a plush, dark-wood finish, naming it after Winston Churchill, and making it look like an English member's bar meets a New York cocktail lounge. The hip and trendy regulars lounge on plush sofas and couches on the first floor sipping fine cocktails under beautiful oil paintings, while downstairs is more of a dance space with DJs spinning jazzy sounds. All around you though you can order fine cocktails and flirt with dashing boys and girls. For all its hip quotient, it's surprisingly welcoming and laid-back.

Boasting a laid back pub vibe and a lively atmosphere, this place attracts a young crowd eager to kick back with a drink. A relaxed hang out on weekdays, its relatively small size and narrow layout means it can get crazily packed on weekends, but even then the atmosphere is still pretty friendly. Music is an agreeable mix of funk and soul and the house DJs really know how to do their thing and get people going. Formerly the Modern Green Bar, this is a top spot for those who like their tunes smooth.

Dominik Galander’s eponymous Kreuzberg bar – part of a mini liquid empire - is a cosy, friendly place with a main bar area in the front, a few tables scattered in the back, and a piano in the corner for when the mood for music strikes. Most of the crowd are local but everyone is made to feel welcome. The bar tenders are down to earth and easy-going. They stock a good range of beer, an excellent selection of wine and can mix up a Golden Age cocktail for you, everything from a potent Gin Rickey to a smooth, sweet 1940s Golden Cadillac to a fruity Pusser’s Painkiller from the 1970s. Try their three course liquid dinner if you want a real treat: an aperitif followed by something more full-blooded chased with a sweet dessert cocktail. The staff are knowledgeable and will happily regale you with stories of the bar tender’s art and the history of the things you’re drinking. A solid, welcoming neighbourhood bar that’s a cut above the average and, as such, much recommended. ;52.491947904883766,13.383178263902664;http://bar.galander-berlin.de;;4,93029E+11;closed;18:00-02:00;18:00-02:00;18:00-02:00;18:00-02:00;18:00-02:00;18:00-02:00;Bar,Cocktail;;false;;false;$$$;cash,mastercard,americanexpress;;;;;;;;;;12954791;http://instagram.com/GALANDER+%E2%80%93+Kreuzberg+%E2%80%93;;4b45dba2f964a520431126e3;https://foursquare.com/v/galander--kreuzberg-/4b45dba2f964a520431126e3;;;12;197;6;;true;[County, PostalCode, Website, Phone, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, OutdoorSeating, Wifi, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Country, Street1, GeocoordinateString]

Conveniently located above the Anchovie Cafe near Mototanaka Station, the drinks are cheaper than most spots this side of town and the cheery regular barmen don't skimp on the shots. Beers and vodka-based cocktails seem to be popular with the regulars, a mix of with-it youngsters and more sober professionals.

Gyrate with some  Margarita while drinking a margarita on a dance floor as large as a cane  field. DJs spin everything from trip-hop to salsa and cheesy theme nights  like the 'Miss Hawaiian Tropic Model Search' are worth the entrance alone.

This means they are ideally situated for soaking up the hotel spill-over crowd looking to continue the fun after the Bowery’s lobby bar closes at 2am. Owners are nightlife impresarios Larry Kramer and Craig Koenig, also of R&R and Retreat, and in this watering hole they’ve aimed for a touch of Prohibition-era decorum. There’s no need to jostle for space at the bar of this semi-private lounge. In fact, there is no bar - Antik offers its patrons bottle service or a selection of classic New York cocktails brought directly to the table by cocktail servers. Antik prides itself on its intimate, discreet atmosphere, so with just eight tables and space for only 74 people, reservations are recommended if you want to secure yourself a prime spot among the trendsetters who gather here. Cocktails include the Cowboy, a jalapeno-infused margarita, and the Hi Ho – gin, white port and bitters – and are mostly on the money, though they can veer towards the sugary-sweet at times. Housed in the old Marion’s Marquee space, it can be a tad self-conscious, but it still has its own charms. The appealing decor mixes burgundy and gold walls with sumptuous drapes, opulent chandeliers and marble-topped tables for a 21st Century hipster interpretation of the 1920s speakeasy. Staff are attentive and the VIP area is truly cool. With some killer tunes thrown in, this one’s a grower.;40.726779,-73.9916389;http://drshameera.blogspot.com;;1,60196E+11;;;;;;;;Bar,Dive;;;;;;;;;;;;1,16313E+14;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Antik/116312841790504;;;635746;http://instagram.com/Antik;;4a02e559f964a52072711fe3;https://foursquare.com/v/antik/4a02e559f964a52072711fe3;4;99;1;378;5;;true;[County, Street2, Website, Category, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[PostalCode, Street1, GeocoordinateString, Phone]

The chic, streamlined party space is set over two floors and features two bars. The upper floor is the main lounge and is decked out with rows of funky dining booths, while the lower level provides the dance floor, where you’ll find some of the best DJs in the city doing their thing. The adventurous food menu offers quirky and imaginative dishes. Billed as “international tapas” they mix modern Italian with the best of European – so expect everything from chicken quesadillas to tasty goats cheese ravioli. The food may be good but it's the drinks you really come for: Lily is known for rustling up a string of crafty creations such as the Bowl of Beauty (vodka-laced Jell-O), the Pollyanna (raspberry vodka, strawberry juice and prosecco) and, our favourite, the Royal Family Martini made with a monstrous, but entirely welcome, helping of Beefeater Gin. The nightlife is plentiful here on College Street, but it’s of a slightly more mature order than the city’s downtown clubland district. So you’ll find a sophisticated, artsy crowd hanging out at Lily, and baggy jeans and trainers will be frowned upon.  And if you think the bar staff are gorgeous, you’re in for a treat, the late-night downstairs regulars are even hotter.";43.65524,-79.41636;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lily-lounge/130261820374168;info@lilylounge.com;14165320419;closed;closed;closed;closed;22:00-03:00;closed;closed;Nightlife,Live music;;;;;$;;;;;street;;2,66172E+14;https://www.facebook.com/LilyLoungeMarch14;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;true;[County, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, PriceRange, ParkingType, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins];[Street1, GeocoordinateString, Website, Phone]

Expect an eclectic mix of musical styles from original jazz and swing, to bebop and fusion, played by local musicians who may look like they should be on mandolins but are as expert on strings and brass as their Chicago and New Orleans counterparts. The bar is spread over three floors – the first is geared towards enjoying the music up close, the second for letting the music drift into the background as guests chat with friends, and the third for private parties and the VIP crowd. But the jazz is what it’s really all about here. Two groups perform every night, each playing two sets between 7:30pm and 12:40am, so you can be sure of some top notch entertainment whatever time you roll up. World-renowned musicians are known to frequent this intimate drinking hole, along with the trendsetting local crowd and foreigners who have heard tell of the swinging jazz and smooth atmosphere. It’s also a popular location for shooting films, TV shows and commercials. The food is a pricey but top-class mix of French, Mexican and local dishes - try the lobster or the rib eye steak if you’re really looking to push the boat out - and the drinks menu more than matches it for quality and quantity. More than 100 wines are available and your cocktails are named after jazz musicians. A Dizzy Gillespie anyone?

The décor is colourful and cluttered, with a degree of kitsch appeal, featuring as it does an abundance of quirky lampshades, a makeshift garden area and a healthy scattering of tiki trinkets. The bar stocks an array of tequilas and the cocktail list is lengthy and inventive. They even offer cocktail flights if you want to give your palate a work-out without getting overly refreshed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The old bank vault is now a drinking den and you can recline on great soft couches sampling their wide selection of Saint specials, all the time knowing your money is safe with the management. The various cosmopolitans on offer seemed popular with the luscious young Kylie look-alikes we came across, but fruity muddles were also available. Out back is a Balinese (or is it Japanese?) inspired garden, where it's just fine to lie back in summer, sip a cocktail and pretend you're Simon Templar.

The futuristic design makes it seem like you are entering a spaceship and the state-of-the-art lighting and sound system continue the effect. They play house, soul, funk and cutting edge techno and the staff mix up some mean martinis too. So much for Vienna being the home of the coffee house.

Bear this in mind when marvelling at the decor of Melbourne's Transport Hotel, with its brand of gleaming industrial minimalism complete with arterial chrome beer pipes, and polished terrazzo floors off which even the most fastidious would happily eat their dinner.  Misleadingly titled a a hotel, in truth Transport is a bar, and it offers a chic that one does not always associate with Australia. Which is unfair.

With its welcoming vibe and plenty of space to sit inside and out this is a popular destination with both locals and visitors. Located just behind the Hamilton Hotel in Itaewon and sheltered from the urban murk, Gecko’s has an air of the countryside resort about it, with wicker seats and terracotta patio tiles making you feel far removed from the urban jungle of Seoul. The restaurant is lined with numerous large windows, giving diners a view of the lush garden outside and lending the room a touch of that al fresco feeling. The eclectic menu draws its influence from all over Europe, with pasta and salad dishes available for lunch while a selection of tapas, steaks and burgers is on the dinner menu. The lively barbecues they host from Friday to Sunday are also popular. A chilled, relaxed spot, it makes an ideal place for a relaxing lunch or group dinner, or simply lingering long with an icy beer, a crisp glass of sauvignon, or a refreshing strawberry daiquiri. Its iced tea-flavoured sorbets, served with an assortment of fruit, also go down well when the temperature soars, particularly with the female clientele. From 12 – 5pm the usual additional tax of 10 per cent is waived so guests can enjoy their food and drink at lower prices. ;37.5350217726525,126.9929677248;;geckosgarden@hotmail.com;+82 2-790-0540;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;false;[];[]

For more than a decade it’s been the place to see and be seen in Toronto, and in that time its decor has been through various guises, from minimalist to Miami South Beach, via Moroccan chic. In 2011 its latest look was revealed, with a beachy theme turning the bar and lounge into an outdoorsy-feeling space reminiscent of old Hollywood or 1950s Havanna. Turquoise art deco trims, banana leaf prints and a gleaming new bar made of Calcutta marble all combine to create a space that is warmer and more welcoming than the previous all white space. Hip Toronto artist Matt McNaught was also hired to create and edgy green graffiti mural at the entrance. And while the new interior is a breath of fresh air, in summer months drinkers tend to decamp to the alluring patio for the real thing. The place attracts an A-list crowd, particularly during Toronto International Film Festival, and the Champagne and Grey Goose is often to be found flowing freely as the DJ spins some seductive house and upbeat tunes. The cocktails are pretty spot on too, ranging from the dry classics to more colourful concoctions. Some Havana-inspired twists have also been added to the drinks menu go with the new decor. But it's the Mexican-Mediterranean fusion food that sets the place apart, a welcome departure from the Italian/Provencal fare that's so usual in this area. The menu includes lobster quesadilla and Moroccan Lamb chops and the owner is a Syrian. Now that's what we call fusion.;43.670324838906,-79.392816223384;http://www.amberinyorkville.com/;;14169269037;;;;;;;;Bar,Pub;;;;;;;;;;;;1,7908E+14;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Amber/179079548804396;;;242710573;http://instagram.com/Amber;;;;376;2319;;;;;true;[County, Category, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins];[PostalCode, Street1, GeocoordinateString, Phone]

Located in the rolling hills of Covignano -  Rimini's Beverly Hills - Paradiso regulars are high-flying stars from the  world of film, fashion and culture. That said, if you arrive in the right  car, wear the right suit and have the right all-over body tan, there's no  reason you can't join them. The multi-roomed venue includes a large central  dance floor, a quiet chill-out room with billiard tables and sofas, and,  bizarrely, a New Age lounge area where you can drink herbal teas, sample the  health products and have a massage in a smoke and alcohol-free environment.  We prefer the alcohol-fuelled areas though and suggest you sip a martini in  the main bar and watch the dance-floor crowd get frisky over pop, house,  disco, blues and funk tunes played by the house DJs. More a lifestyle choice  than a club, we guarantee you won't want to leave Paradise.  ;44.0309,12.5455;;info@paradisoclub.it;00 39 0541 751132;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;false;[];[]

Located in the former French Concession, it’s a hip and chilled spot that offers a superb array of sake and shochu based cocktails. Simply decorated with raw stone walls and the odd artfully placed plant, it has a low-key intimate feel and the staff are efficient in a laid-back kind of way. Their smooth saketini is a pleasant fusion tipple and they stock over 40 shochu varieties and 20 sakes if you want your drink unadulterated. They also serve beer if spirits aren’t your thing. Soft jazzy music provides the soundtrack to your evening and they sometimes feature live bands;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With chandeliers and gold-leaf walls, timber floors and artfully strewn cushions, the mood is by turns intimate and hedonistic. A luxurious sofa wraps around the bar and leads to an even cosier room. As the shadows of the candles flicker against the ruby red walls, it feels as if you have inadvertently entered an opium den.  The beautiful people sip cocktails in the separate lounge before taking their seats to sample chef Ryan Crawford's French-Vietnamese fare. Rest assured that the bar staff are more than equal to the high standard set in the kitchen. Tamara's Libertini, for example, is a delicious ode to gin with lychee and grapefruit. Small wonder then that this compelling marriage of cocktails and chopsticks has lured so many social butterflies, and one hopes it will continue to do so.;-27.46525123864517,153.01311492919922;http://www.libertine.net.au;;61733673353;17:00-22:30;17:00-22:00;12:00-14:30,17:00-22:30;12:00-14:30,17:00-22:30;12:00-14:30,17:00-22:30;12:00-14:30,17:00-22:30;12:00-14:30,17:00-22:30;Bar,Cocktail,Restaurant;;true;true;false;$$;cash,creditcards;groups,outdoor,reserve,dinner,lunch;foursquare.com/v/libertine-bar--restaurant/4be3bfd61dd22d7f4d7a97bd/menu;;lot;;1,3288E+14;https://www.facebook.com/libertine.net.au;libertinebris;https://www.twitter.com/libertinebris;229571726;http://instagram.com/Libertine+Bar+and+Restaurant;;4be3bfd61dd22d7f4d7a97bd;https://foursquare.com/v/libertine-bar--restaurant/4be3bfd61dd22d7f4d7a97bd;3883;2967;7;554;15;;true;[County, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, OutdoorSeating, HappyHour, Wifi, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, MenuUrl, ParkingType, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, TwitterName, TwitterUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[City, PostalCode, Street1, Street2, GeocoordinateString, Phone]

It’s a smallish space with a few boxy benches outside on the pavement. Inside there’s a grand chandelier which is juxtaposed with more quirky and down to earth décor. There is local art on the walls and a few potted plants dotted about the place.Run by Vasil Karov and Nico Hubenov, Zest offers a range of drinks – beers, teas and a nice line in Bulgarian wines as well as a small range of cocktails. Keeps things simply and you’ll be best rewarded. The café-bar also serves a range of tapas/mezze plates as well as a number of Bulgarian-influenced dishes, including a delicious organic Bulgarian potato salad, and various Bulgarian stews, like guveche, stuffed peppers and a vegan bobchorba soup – in fact vegans and vegetarians are surprisingly well catered to here  though there are also burgers if you’d prefer. The atmosphere is laid back and welcoming and later in the evening, with local DJs behind the decks, the place has a really nice buzz about it, cool and convivial.

The Melbourne-based Bar and Grill allows you to sample Perry’s food – based on an ethos of insanely fresh produce cooked simply and well – without inflicting as much damage on your wallet (though that’s not to say it’s cheap, far from it). The Bates Smart designed room is airy and impressive. You can opt to dine in the restaurant proper - the wagyu beef is divine - or lounge in the bar, sipping top quality cocktails and perusing a menu of bar food far, far above the usual snacks and platters.  A great place to impress a date or simply to unwind after work with a superb glass of wine and an out-of-this-world burger.;-37.82178544741225,144.95992183685303;http://www.rockpool.com/melbourne/;;61386481900;;;;;;;;Restaurant,Nightlife,House;;false;;;;cash,creditcards;dinner,lunch;foursquare.com/v/rockpool-bar--grill/4b0a16a6f964a520ae2123e3/menu;;;;;;rockpoolgroup;https://www.twitter.com/rockpoolgroup;1967011;http://instagram.com/Rockpool+Bar+%26+Grill;;4b0a16a6f964a520ae2123e3;https://foursquare.com/v/rockpool-bar--grill/4b0a16a6f964a520ae2123e3;;;53;2199;55;;true;[County, Phone, Category, OutdoorSeating, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, MenuUrl, TwitterName, TwitterUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[City, PostalCode, Street1, Street2, GeocoordinateString, Website]

;American Junkie;US;IL;Chicago;60654;;15 W Illinois St Fl 2;N State St;A new addition to a burgeoning mini chain of West Coast-based eateries, the River North branch of American Junkie seems determined to set itself apart from its siblings.;A new addition to a burgeoning mini chain of West Coast-based eateries, the River North branch of American Junkie seems determined to set itself apart from its siblings. The venue is attempting to mark itself out in more ways than one. This is a far more upmarket affair than its predecessors – to let people know it’s more than just a big noisy sports bar where people have a propensity to dance on the tables - with a food menu that’s chef driven and seasonal, featuring dishes like a double decker burger - made with LaFrieda beef from New York – and smoked pork shoulder. The cocktail programme echoes that sense of repositioning, with a decent array of drinks that will please the masses while also keeping the purists happy. Fresh juices and fresh, seasonal berries play a big part in the mixed drinks, while they also stock some on-trend kegged cocktails, which are set to change seasonally. It’s a vast, sprawling space, spread over two floors, which seats around 320 in all and proudly boasts “one of the Midwest’s largest high-definition TV screens” in addition to a retractable roof for nights when the weather is warmer and a ‘descending DJ booth’ for nights when you want to hit the dance floor  - after your chef-driven, seasonal dinner and quality cocktails, that is.;41.89075319634731,-87.62847661972046;http://www.americanjunkiechi.com;;13122390995;closed;17:00-02:00;19:00-02:00;19:00-02:00;19:00-02:00;19:00-03:00;12:00-00:00;Nightlife,Nightclub,Bar,Lounge,Cocktail,DJ;Casual;true;;true;$$$;cash,amex,mastercard,visa,discover;groups,outdoor,reserve,dinner,lunch;foursquare.com/v/american-junkie/51327549e4b0f53f8fcf31b7/menu;;street,valet;Red Line to Grand;1,3246E+14;https://www.facebook.com/chicagojunkie;atticatjunkie;https://www.twitter.com/atticatjunkie;71761266;http://instagram.com/American+Junkie+Chicago;;528180be11d2f33611d3c384;https://foursquare.com/v/attic-at-american-junkie/528180be11d2f33611d3c384;7627;37412;4;39;0;;true;[County, Street2, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, Mood, OutdoorSeating, Wifi, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, MenuUrl, ParkingType, PublicTransport, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, TwitterName, TwitterUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[PostalCode, Street1, GeocoordinateString, Website, Phone]

Inside it’s airy and open, but with defined areas for dining and drinking. The décor is contemporary and urban, lots of bare brick and soft brown leather, sculptural light fittings, a dramatic wooden bookcase (complete with grandfather clock) which bisects the space and a roaring fireplace which beckons temptingly on cold nights. The cocktail list features all the classics and has a definite New York leaning: Manhattans, Old Fashioneds, and the like, More contemporary creation include a Gingerbread Martini, a sweet, fruity Apricot Squeeze, the punchy, chili-laced Sofrito, the blueberry-packed West Hampton and for those with seriously sweet teeth, a Jaffa Cake Martini and, gulp, a Werther’s Original Martini.  There’s a substantial wine list and a decent food menu too. More sophisticated than some places on the strip, it has a relaxed but stylish atmosphere and has something to offer both those popping in to unwind after work and those out to make an evening of it. ;-41.29331,174.782102;http://www.theapartment.co.nz/;;6443859771;08:00-00:00;08:00-00:00;08:00-00:00;08:00-01:30;12:00-03:00;12:00-03:00;closed;Bar,Lounge,Cocktail,Wine;Casual;true;true;;$$;cash,amex,mastercard,visa;groups,outdoor,reserve;;;street;Bus and taxi services available.;1,75114E+14;https://www.facebook.com/theapartmentbarwgtn;;;416565;http://instagram.com/The+Apartment;;4bf5c3da92d1952153a6591f;https://foursquare.com/v/the-apartment-wellington/4bf5c3da92d1952153a6591f;2189;3847;4;743;4;;true;[County, Website, MondayOpenHours, TuesdayOpenHours, WednesdayOpenHours, ThursdayOpenHours, FridayOpenHours, SaturdayOpenHours, SundayOpenHours, Category, Mood, OutdoorSeating, HappyHour, PriceRange, PaymentAccepted, RestaurantServices, ParkingType, PublicTransport, FacebookId, FacebookUserPage, InstagramId, InstagramUserPage, FoursquareId, FoursquareUserPage, FacebookLikes, FacebookCheckins, FoursquareLikes, FoursquareCheckIns, FoursquareTips];[Country, GeocoordinateString, Phone]

The food menu is international in influence, mixing traditional noodle dishes with pizza and sandwiches.  The design of the space is stylish and urban, lots of wood, chrome and old stone, with a stage area on one side of the room. Live music is a big part of this place’s appeal.

It's a loose term, but essentially that means wines made from organic grapes as well as those made with no added sugar or sulphur or any of the other extras that sneak in during the wine-making process. This is all well and good but would count for nowt were the wines not top notch. Fortunately they are and the list is thick with varieties the average quaffer may not have heard of. The food is excellent too. They serve inventive French-inspired dishes, well-sourced charcuterie and a wide range of artisanal cheeses - the perfect accompaniment to glass of something earthy and unusual.

;Casablanca Lounge;DE;;Berlin;;;Waldeyerstraße 9 10247 Berlin;;A beach bar in the heart of Berlin?

Given the changeable nature of the German weather, that might seem folly itself, but that’s what Casablanca Lounge is aiming to be. To this end there are soft yellow walls, several potted palms dotted about the room and a whole load of sand on the floor (yep, that’s right, actual sand, the stuff that gets in your shoes and sandwiches). Flip-flops are practically de rigeur here – those who like to be a bit dressier on their nights out might find the whole thing slightly tiresome. But while it may not be the most stylish spot in the city, it is huge fun: a lively spot for a post-work drink. A longish cocktail menu covers all the bases, including an unusually big selection of cachaca-based drinks, and they serve a decent selection of beers. There are daily changing promotions where particular types of drink are on offer (eg, Becks day, highball days, etc) as well as a generous happy hour that’s sure to please those who want to drink on a budget. It’s also open during the day, so you can enjoy a cool drink or a coffee beneath the swaying palms (OK, they don’t really sway, but we’re just going with the flow). While you’re never going to forget that you’re in an urban bar – a theme bar no less – there’s something about it that’s appealingly kitschy if you go in the right state of mind. So sit back and sip your Mai Tai and pretend you’re somewhere sunny and ocean adjacent. ;52.515412906171,13.4717434644699;http://www.casablancalounge.de/;;+49 30 44706862;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;false;[];[]
